# How To

**Kafka** is a highly complex tool, so the **FastStream** `KafkaBroker` API can be complicated and confusing in specific cases. Our main documentation sections cover only the primary **FastStream** and **Kafka** concepts. Therefore, this section provides concrete **FastStream - Kafka** examples that you can use in your regular services as copy-paste code or, at the very least, as a reference.

We (**airt** team) hope that this section will be maintained by the community. Please feel free to add any examples/sections or edit existing ones. If you haven't found the solution in the docs yet, this is a great opportunity to add a new article here!

To add a new page to this section, simply add a new **Markdown** file to the [`docs/docs/en/howto/kafka`](https://github.com/airtai/faststream/tree/main/docs/docs/en/howto/kafka){.external-link target="_blank"} directory and update the [`navigation_template.txt`](https://github.com/airtai/faststream/blob/main/docs/docs/navigation_template.txt){.external-link target="_blank"} file.
