# Context Extra Options

Additionally, `Context` provides you with some extra capabilities for working with containing objects.

## Default Values

For instance, if you attempt to access a field that doesn't exist in the global context, you will receive a `pydantic.ValidationError` exception.

However, you can set default values if needed.

## Cast Context Types

By default, context fields are **NOT CAST** to the type specified in their annotation.

If you require this functionality, you can enable the appropriate flag.

## Initial Value

Also, `Context` provides you with a `initial` option to setup base context value without previous `set_global` call.
