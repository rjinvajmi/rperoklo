# Tasks Scheduling

**FastStream** is a framework for asynchronous service development. It allows you to build disturbed event-based systems in an easy way. Tasks scheduling is a pretty often use case in such systems.

Unfortunately, this functional conflicts with the original **FastStream** ideology and can't be implemented as a part of the framework. But, you can integrate scheduling in your **FastStream** application by using some extra dependencies. And we have some receipts on how to make it.

## Taskiq-FastStream

[**Taskiq**](https://github.com/taskiq-python/taskiq){.external-link target="_blank"} is an asynchronous distributed task queue for python. This project takes inspiration from big projects such as **Celery** and **Dramatiq**.

As a **Celery** replacement, **Taskiq** should support tasks scheduling and delayed publishing, of course. And it does!

By the way, you can easily integrate **FastStream** with the **Taskiq**. It allows you to create cron or delayed tasks to publish messages and trigger some functions this way.

We have a helpful project to provide you with this feature - [**Taskiq-FastStream**](https://github.com/taskiq-python/taskiq-faststream){.external-link target="_blank"}.

!!! note ""
    You can install it by the following command
    ```bash
    pip install taskiq-faststream
    ```

It has two helpful classes `BrokerWrapper` and `AppWrapper` to make your **FastStream** App and Broker objects *taskiq-compatible*.

Let's take a look at the code example.

At first, we should create a regular **FastStream** application.

{! includes/scheduling/app.md !}

### Broker Wrapper

Now, if you want to make it *just working*, we should wrap our `Broker` to special `BrokerWrapper` object:

```python
from taskiq_faststream import BrokerWrapper

taskiq_broker = BrokerWrapper(broker)
```

It creates a *taskiq-compatible* object, that can be used as an object to create a regular [**taskiq** scheduler](https://taskiq-python.github.io/guide/scheduling-tasks.html){.external-link target="_blank"}.

{! includes/scheduling/taskiq_broker.md !}

!!! note ""
    We patched the original `TaskiqScheduler` to support message generation callbacks, but its signature remains the same.

`#!python broker.task(...)` has the same with the original `broker.publish(...)` signature and allows you to plan your publishing tasks using the great **taskiq** `schedule` option (you can learn more about it [here](https://taskiq-python.github.io/available-components/schedule-sources.html#labelschedulesource){.external-link target="_blank"}).

Finally, to run the scheduler, please use the **taskiq CLI** command:

```bash
taskiq scheduler module:scheduler
```

### Application Wrapper

If you don't want to lose application **AsyncAPI** schema or/and lifespans, you can wrap not the broker, but the application itself using `AppWrapper` class.

```python
from taskiq_faststream import AppWrapper

taskiq_broker = AppWrapper(app)
```

It allows you to use `taskiq_broker` the same way with the previous example, but saves all original **FastStream** features.

!!! tip
    Creating a separated *Scheduler* service is a best way to make really disturbed and sustainable system. In this case, you can just create an empty **FastStream** broker and use **Taskiq-FastStream** integration to publish your messages (consuming by another services).

### Generate message payload

Also, you are able to determine message payload right before sending and do not use the final one. To make it, just replace `message` option from the final value to function (sync or async), that returns data to send:

```python
async def collect_information_to_send():
    return "Message to send"

taskiq_broker.task(
    message=collect_information_to_send,
    ...
)
```

It allows you to collect some data from database, request an outer API, or use another ways to generate data to send right before sending.

More than, you can send not one, but multiple messages per one task using this feature. Just turn your message callback function to generator (sync or async) - and **Taskiq-FastStream** will iterate over your payload and publish all of your messages!

```python
async def collect_information_to_send():
    """Publish 10 messages per task call."""
    for i in range(10):
        yield i

taskiq_broker.task(
    message=collect_information_to_send,
    ...
)
```

## Rocketry

Also, you can integrate your **FastStream** application with any other libraries provides you with a scheduling functional.

As an example, you can use [**Rocketry**](https://github.com/Miksus/rocketry){.external-link target="_blank"}:

```python linenums="1"
import asyncio

from rocketry import Rocketry
from rocketry.args import Arg

from faststream.nats import NatsBroker

app = Rocketry(execution="async")

broker = NatsBroker()      # regular broker
app.params(broker=broker)

async def start_app():
    async with broker:     # connect broker
        await app.serve()  # run rocketry

@app.task("every 1 second", execution="async")
async def publish(br: NatsBroker = Arg("broker")):
    await br.publish("Hi, Rocketry!", "test")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(start_app())
```
