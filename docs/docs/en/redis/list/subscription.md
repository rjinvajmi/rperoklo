# Redis List Basic Subscriber

To start consuming from a **Redis** list, simply decorate your consuming function with the `#!python @broker.subscriber(...)` decorator, passing a string as the list key.

In the following example, we will create a simple FastStream app that will consume messages from a `#!python "test-list"` Redis list.

The full app code looks like this:

```python linenums="1"
{! docs_src/redis/list/list_sub.py [ln:1-10] !}
```

## Import FastStream and RedisBroker

To use the `#!python @broker.subscriber(...)` decorator, first, we need to import the base FastStream app and RedisBroker to create our broker.

```python linenums="1"
{! docs_src/redis/list/list_sub.py [ln:1-2] !}
```

## Create a RedisBroker

Next, we will create a `RedisBroker` object and wrap it into the `FastStream` object so that we can start our app using CLI later.

```python linenums="1"
{! docs_src/redis/list/list_sub.py [ln:4-5] !}
```

## Create a Function that will Consume Messages from a Redis list

Letâ€™s create a consumer function that will consume messages from `#!python "test-list"` Redis list and log them.

```python linenums="1"
{! docs_src/redis/list/list_sub.py [ln:8-10] !}
```

The function decorated with the `#!python @broker.subscriber(...)` decorator will be called when a message is pushed to the **Redis** list.

The message will then be injected into the typed `msg` argument of the function, and its type will be used to parse the message.

In this example case, when the message is pushed to a `#!python "test-list"` list, it will be received by the `handle` function, and the `logger` will log the message content.
