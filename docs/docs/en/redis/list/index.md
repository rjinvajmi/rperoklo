# Redis Lists

[Redis Lists](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/lists/){.external-link target="_blank"} are a simple and flexible data structure that function as ordered collections of strings. They are similar to lists in programming languages, and **Redis** provides commands to perform a variety of operations such as adding, retrieving, and removing elements from either end of the list.

**Redis Lists** are particularly useful for scenarios such as implementing queues, effectively using the list as a **FIFO** (First-In-First-Out) structure.
